In order to provide estimate for classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","<font size=\"3\"><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <i>y</i>, to some predictors (independent variables <i>x1</i>, <i>x2</i>, etc.). Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n","<br><br>\n","$$\n","y = w0 + w1 \\times x1 + w2 \\times x2 + \\cdots\n","$$\n","<br>\n","and finds the values of <i>w0</i>, <i>w1</i>, <i>w2</i>, etc. The term <i>w0</i> is the \"intercept\" or \"constant term\" (it's shown as <i>b</i> in the formula below):\n","<br><br>\n","$$\n","Y = W X + b\n","$$\n","<p></p>\n","\n","</div>\n","\n","Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <i>y</i>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n","\n","Despite the name logistic <i>regression</i>, it is actually a <b>probabilistic classification</b> model. Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function:\n","\n","$$\n","ProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{e^y}{1 + e^y} = exp(y) / (1 + exp(y)) = p \n","$$\n","\n","which produces p-values between 0 (as y approaches minus infinity $-\\infty$) and 1 (as y approaches plus infinity $+\\infty$). This now becomes a special kind of non-linear regression.\n","\n","In this equation, <i>y</i> is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), <code>exp</code> is the exponential function and $\\theta(y)$ is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\">logistic function</a>, also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve), and was first developed for modeling population growth.\n","\n","You might also have seen this function before, in another configuration:\n","\n","$$\n","ProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-y}}\n","$$\n","\n","So, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid function but then treats the result as a probability:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/kgv9alcghmjcv97op4d6onkyxevk23b1.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\">\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f38bdfb9-a999-4fec-97b9-6096fcc529ba","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["* * *\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f68db618-667a-4cd5-82f7-48d22bee72de","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["<a id=\"ref2\"></a>\n","\n","<h2>Utilizing Logistic Regression in TensorFlow</h2>\n","\n","We begin by installing TensorFlow version 2.9.0 and its required prerequistes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"18a6a3db-e41f-4880-a2cc-e04f50154bd1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install grpcio==1.24.3\n!pip install tensorflow==2.9.0\n!pip install --upgrade scikit-learn numpy"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f89ea187-e087-4865-9b83-01c881fb2323","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["**Restart kernel for latest version of TensorFlow to be activated, then continue to the next step.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b95cf00a-cf31-4737-8c7f-81a33b982844","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["For us to utilize Logistic Regression in TensorFlow, we first need to import the required libraries.
